# SensorApplication

## Introduction
Sensor Application extends beyond the base code functions, integrating advanced sensor usage to give user an insight of the time and percentage of the phone on certain orientations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Android SDK
- Android Studio (for building and installing the application)
- An Android device or emulator running Android SDK version 21 (Lollipop) or higher

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vuvnguyen95/SensorApplication.git
   ```

3. Build the project by navigating to `Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s)`.
4. Install the APK on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage
- **Orientation Display:** The application continuously reads sensor data to determine and
display the device's current azimuth, pitch, and roll (base code).
- **Usage Tracker:** Time spent in each orientation is tracked and aggregated to showcase the
device usage pattern in percentages.
- **Interactive UI:** An interactive button allows users to toggle the visibility of the usage
statistics, promoting a clean and user-friendly interface.
